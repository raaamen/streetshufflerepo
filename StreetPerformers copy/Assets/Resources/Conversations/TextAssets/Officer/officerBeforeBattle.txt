HEY WOAH STOP!!! STOP THE SINGING AND THE DANCING AND THE CARD TRICKS!!!
Do you kids have a permit!?
[Mascot]
A… a what now?
[#Cop]
A PERMIT!!!
We don’t let just ANYONE use the road as their own little kiddie playground!
[Mascot]
I thought kids weren’t allowed to play in the street… are we breaking the law?? Koko’s too squishy for jail!
[#Cop]
YES, YOU KIDS ARE BREAKING THE LAW!! Busking without a permit is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN!!!
I’m gonna have to ask you brats to SCRAM!!
[Mascot]
HOLD ON!!! KOKO WON’T TOLERATE BEING CALLED A BRAT!!
KOKO KNOWS WHO SHE IS!! ACE!!!! LET’S SHOW THIS COP WHO’S BOSS
[Ace]
Isn’t fighting the police illegal?
[Mascot]
Koko didn’t know fighting a police officer was a crime, the more you know!
[#Cop]
Y’know, when I was your age, I had big dreams of being a performer.
But life isn’t all sunshine and rainbows and happy times being a menace to society.
Life is REAL. Life is HARD WORK!!!
[Mascot]
I dunno officer, Koko thinks performing is pretty hard. Maybe you should try it sometime.
[#Cop]
WHY YOU LITTLE- THAT’S IT! I’LL MAKE YOU BRATS A DEAL!
If you can beat me in a performance, I’ll give you ONE MORE CHANCE to get that permit.
If not, I’ll see you in the back of my cruiser! HYAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
