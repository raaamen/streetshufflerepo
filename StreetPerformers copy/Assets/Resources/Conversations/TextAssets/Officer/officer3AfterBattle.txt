[#Cop]
Hrrrrgh… you damn kids! I-I can’t believe you guys.
[Mascot]
NOW do we have a permit??
[#Cop]
Why do I even bother… I’ll never get to be a performer.
I feel just how I did 10 years ago. Beaten, alone, shivering on the dirty, gum-covered, probably disease-ridden sidewalk.
I was a street performer… doing tricks… trying to please an audience… but I was A FAILURE. A DISAPPOINTMENT TO MY FAMILY!!!!
[Mascot]
Koko wouldn’t go THAT far. You’re just fine, Mr. Cop, sir.
If you want to be a performer like us, why don’t you just - I dunno - quit?
[Ace]
Koko’s right, why don’t you just stop being a cop? 
[#Cop]
IT’S NOT THAT SIMPLE!!
Being an officer gives me dignity. It gives me PRIDE! IT GETS ME A REASON TO GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING!!
BEING A POLICE OFFICER-
Wasn’t what I ever wanted to do…
[Mascot]
Mmmhmmm. Feel like we’ve heard this before.
Ya’ gonna quit or what? Koko is tired of standing around and doesn’t have all day.
[#Cop]
Maybe I’ll take a leave, or a vacation.
Maybe I’ll just take some night classes around performing.
Or maybe I can take a night shift?
[Ace]
JUST QUIT!
[#Cop]
OK OK! I QUIT! I QUIT I QUIT I QUIT! GOSH IT FEELS GOOD TO SAY!
Thank you children. I owe a lot to you rascals. As for the permit… I didn’t see anything.
Sigh… I wonder if The Magician needs a new sidekick?
[Ace]
The Magician?
[#Cop]
Oh ho ho, you mean you don’t know about THE MAGICIAN?
Well, ah, you’ll know about her soon! She’s coming after all.
I was supposed to be security. Not anymore!
I’ll be up on stage with her! Good luck children! And thank you!
[Mascot]
WAAAIT! GRRRRR!!  Does this mean Koko finally has a permit??
CAN SOMEONE TELL KOKO IF SHE HAS A PERMIT??
