[Ace]
Huff... puff... she's... done...
[Contortionist]
Hah... we did it.
[Mascot]
KOKO'S ARM HURTS FROM PUNCHING!
[Mime]
..........
[#Magician]
You damn kids. Embarrassing me on my own stage. I can't believe this.
[Ace]
I hope you've learned something, Magician.
[Mascot]
YEAH! Just because Koko performs for people on the sidewalk doesn't mean Koko isn't talented! Koko beat you after all!
[Mime]
..........
[Mascot]
Exactly! Koko is just as real a performer as you! Ms. Snooty Magician! Ms. Bossy Girl!
[#Magician]
..........
Sigh...
I'm a fool. I don't deserve this stage that I stand on.
[Contortionist]
I don't wanna be THAT GUY but nah. You don't. Jerk.
[#Ace]
Woah, woah, hey! I think she's already feeling pretty bad.
[Mascot]
Does Ace forget that she almost tried to kill Koko a few minutes ago?
[#Ace]
Well... yeah. She did. But she also brought us together. 
I was nervous about this. Not just about fighting her, but performing in the streets. 
It's hard to see myself as a real magician when I'm out there, collecting pennies in a hat, hoping someone big will notice me. 
I've learned a lot while performing with you guys and facing people who didn't believe in us!
[#]
[Contortionist]
Yeaaaah, I gueeess you have a point. I definitely had tons of fun being with you guys!
[Mascot]
Koko's so happy to have met her new friends! 
Koko wishes she could do this forever, with even MORE friends!
[Mime]
..........
[Ace]
Hmm. Hey, Magician. Do you have any friends?
[#Magician]
Friends. Ahh. Not many. I don't become friends with weaklings who don't compare to my immense power. 
Although... after that battle... can I even call myself powerful.
[Contortionist]
Ok now I feel weirdly bad. Uuuuuugh!
Do you... sigh... want to be friends?
[#Magician]
Friends...? After we just tried beating each other up in front of a live audience?
[Ace]
About that audience...
[]
*crowd booing*
[Ace]
I think they still want a show!
[Mascot]
KOKO WANTS TO GIVE 'EM A SHOW! KOKO WAS BORN FOR THIS!!!
[#Magician]
Ah, my precious audience! Unfortunately, I'm too weak to give them a full show.
[Ace]
We'll help out! That's the least we can do after beating you up a bit!
[#Magician]
...
I'm sorry, children. I realize now that you four are special. You have something within me that I lack.
You have forged bonds amongst each other that I sorely lack.
[Contortionist]
WOW, that sure was cheesy. But yeah, you're right! 
You might have been a total jerk, but I guess I can look past it if you let us perform for your audience ;)
[#Wild Guy]
GRRRR, MY HEAD HURTS SO BAD!!!
[#Cop]
It feels like I got punched in the head then ran over with a truck!
[#Statue]
..........
[Contortionist]
Oh yeah! I totally forgot about the other total jerks! Do you guys ALSO wanna be friends?
[#Wild Guy]
Hrrrrmph, you eggheads DID beat the Magician after all. I could use some popularity!
[#Cop]
Wait, you guys are performing with THE MAGICIAN??? I'M IN!
[#Statue]
..........
[Ace]
That settles it!
[#Magician]
Ahem...
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
I apologize for the unexpected intermission! As you have all seen, these... performers put up a wondrous fight!
As a reward for their spirit and their clear talent, they, and their new friends, will perform alongside me for the rest of the show!
GAZE IN AWE AT OUR ASTOUNDING, AWE-INSPIRING PERFORMANCE!
[Wild Guy]
WHO WANTS TO SEE ME EAT FIRE AND DO AN OLLIE?
[Cop]
Finally! A time to show my card tricks! Pick a card! Any card!
[Statue]
..........
[Mime]
..........
[Contortionist]
Watch me bend my body in half! Now watch me do it again! Oooooh!
[Mascot]
WHO WANTS A PICTURE WITH KOKO???
[Ace]
I can take it!
