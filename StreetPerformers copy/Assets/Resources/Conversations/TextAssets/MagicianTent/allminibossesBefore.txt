Koko can have as much popcorn as she wants. Koko brushes her teeth TWICE A DAY!
[Contortionist]

[#Wild Guy]

CRAP!
[Ace]
Huh?? You’re all here?
[#Wild Guy]
Did ya’ think we were gonna miss the SHOW OF A LIFETIME??
THE MAGICIAN??
I’m more surprised that YOU losers are here!
Tickets are expensive for a reason, not just ANYONE can see the Magician
[Mascot]
Oh yeah? Well, not just ANYONE can be as STUPID as YOU!
See, Koko can make funny jokes too!
[#Wild Guy]

Yeah I don't really know much about the mime, but they're with us too.
[#Cop]
Whatever their name, you kids should get out of here! This show is only for REAL performers
[Ace]
Didn’t you only quit your job a few battles ag-
[#Cop]
QUIET YOU! Just because I’m no longer a protector of the public doesn’t mean I can’t put you under CIVILIAN’S ARREST!
[Contortionist]
Protector of the public, eh? 
Didn’t seem like you were doing much protecting when you made my friends get a permit for… card tricks.
Just saying, ehehe!
[Mascot]
OOOOOOOOOOH!!! HE GOT YOU!!
[#Cop]
WHY YOU…. WHO EVEN ARE YOU?
[Contortionist]
I’m Jem ;)
[#Cop]
WELL, “JEM”, we still have some time before the Magician’s show starts. 
Why don’t I give you kids a taste of how much I’ve grown since our last battle?
[Mascot]
KOKO’S ON!
[Mime]

[Contortionist]
Couldn’t have put it better myself, Mime! We’re on!
[#Wild Guy]
HAR HAR HAR!! YOU KIDS DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU’RE IN FOR!

[#Cop]
Indeed! We’ll finish you off just in time for the show! GET READY! HERE WE COME!
