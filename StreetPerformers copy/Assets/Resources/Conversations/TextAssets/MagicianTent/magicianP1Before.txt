[#Magician]
YES, THAT’S RIGHT! I AM THE BEST PERFORM-
Wait, a minute. HOLD THE SHOW! TURN THE LIGHTS ON!
I recognize you three.
Ahhh, yesss, I DEFINITELY know you three.
I’ve seen you on the sidewalks, dancing and prancing around for a pathetic audience.
I HATE PEOPLE LIKE YOU!
DISGRACING THE ART OF STAGE PERFORMANCE!
[Mascot]
Wha…
[#Wild Guy]
Ouch.
[Ace]
What are you TALKING about?
We’re not disgracing anything! We’re just performing!
[#Magician]
REAL performers don’t just show off their skills to any typical passerby. 
Real performers show off their skills to a refined, ticket-holding audience! 
They know the stage like it is their bedroom! 
They spend years training, suffering, bleeding energy into their art until they finally are CAPABLE of showing their true skills to an audience. 
You kids have NO IDEA what I’ve gone through just to be here. 
And here you are, giving strangers on the street the time of day to see your silly little card tricks that any 5 year old could learn. 
It makes me laugh.
[Mascot]
Ok, Koko takes it back. She’s really mean. Koko wants to beat her up.
[#Magician]
PFFFFT, BAHHAHAHAH! DON’T MAKE ME LAUGH! AS IF SOMEONE LIKE YOU COULD TAKE ON THE LIKES OF ME! AAAHAHAHAHAHA!
[Contortionist]
Eh, you’re not so tough. I bet we could beat you! 
Ever had a tomato thrown at you by some random dude in a crowd? 
Ever had some middle schooler steal the coins from your busk jar?
[#Magician]
ENOUGH TALK! Ahem… ATTENTION EVERYONE! I KNOW YOU WERE EXPECTING A SHOW, AND YOU WILL GET YOUR SHOW!
WATCH IN AWE AS I SHOW THESE CHILDREN WHAT A TRUE PERFORMER LOOKS LIKE!
GET READY! HERE I COME! MUAAAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
