Yep. We’re good now.
[Ace-Negative]
Did you just fix a broken ankle??
[#Contortionist(???)]
Nahhh it was just twisted. Just had to uh, y’know, un-twist it. 
[#Contortionist(???)-Cocky]
Easy for me, I’m pretty bendy! ;)
[#Contortionist(???)-Default]
Anyways, you’re pretty cool, man. Wanna, I dunno, team up? Or something?
[Ace]
Sure! I could use a friend to do tricks with.
[#Contortionist]
Yeahhh man, my schedule is pretty… flexible ;) So I can hang around.
Name's Gem by the way. And you are?
[Ace]
I'm Ace!
[#Contortionist]
Ace... Groovy man!
Hey, while we're at it, I've heard there's a special event in Dunkopolis soon.
Apparently there's gonna be a huge show! But tickets are REALLY expensive.
Now that you're here, we can busk twice as fast and twice as good! We'll get the money in no time.
Lookin' forward to doing business with ya'!
