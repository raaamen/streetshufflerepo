[Ace]

[Ace-Negative]
What's the problem? I'm just doing some card tricks.
[#Mascot-Crying]
Koko has been on this block for forever, dancing and getting her picture taken!
You can't just waltz in here and start stealing Koko's audience!
[Ace-Smug]
The street's big enough for the both of us. I'm sure we can just do our funny tricks together, no problem.
[#Mascot-Crying]
No, no, NO! Koko doesn't want to share!!! Koko wants all the crowd's attention on her!
[Ace-Negative]
Isn't that a little conceited?
[#Mascot-Think]
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO KOKO? GRRRRR!!!
[Ace-Default]
Hey, I don't wanna start anything, okay? I'm sorry! You don't have to worry about me!
I'll just move over here and-
[#Mascot]

[Ace]
Fine by me. Let's go!
